\section{Flexible nanoporous materials}

% Among the porous materials used commercially, one can list
% inorganic materials (such as zeolites and silica gels), carbon-based compounds
% (e.g., activated carbon), and hybrid organic--inorganic materials, including the
% topical family of metal-organic frameworks or porous coordination polymers.

% \subsection{ZIF}
%
% ZIFs are built around tetravalent metal centers such as Fe, Co, Zn, Cd or Cu;
% linked together by imidazolate linkers.  They also present the same topology as
% zeolites, with metal(imidazolate)$_2$ building blocks taking the role of
% \ce{SiO2}. The first ZIFs (ZIF-1 to ZIF-12) were synthesized in
% 2006\cite{Park2006}, and found to be water and thermally resistant, which made
% them interesting MOF for commercial applications.
